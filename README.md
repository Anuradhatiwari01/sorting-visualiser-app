# SortVision – Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## What this project does
SortVision is a web application that helps users understand how
sorting algorithms work by showing each step visually.

Instead of only seeing code, users can watch how elements are
compared, swapped, and moved during sorting.

## Why I built this
While learning Data Structures and Algorithms, I found it difficult
to imagine how sorting algorithms work internally.

I built this project to clearly see the step-by-step behavior
of different sorting algorithms.

## Main features
- Visual step-by-step sorting
- Supports common sorting algorithms
- Generate random or custom input arrays
- Upload numbers using a CSV file
- Clear display of comparisons and swaps
- Simple and easy-to-use interface

## Sorting algorithms included
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort

## How the system works
The user selects a sorting algorithm and provides input values.
The backend performs the sorting and sends each step to the frontend.
The frontend displays these steps visually so the user can follow the process.

## Tech used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)

## How to run
1. Install Python
2. Run the backend server
3. Open the frontend in a browser

## What I learned
- How sorting algorithms work internally
- Difference between simple and efficient sorting methods
- How backend logic can support frontend visualization
- How to explain algorithms visually instead of only using code

## Future improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms
- Improve visualization clarity
- Add speed control for animations
